# Sleeping Server Stopper
This mod is a port of the [Sleeping Server Stopper Spigot plugin](https://github.com/vincss/mcEmptyServerStopper) for Forge 1.20 (Haven't checked other versions. Might work).

This is meant to be used with the mod [SleepingServerStarter](https://github.com/vincss/mcsleepingserverstarter) by [vincss](https://github.com/vincss).

I'm basing my mod off of another port which has been archived, [EmptyServerStopper](https://github.com/GHYAKIMA/emptyserverstopper-mod) by [GHYAKIMA](https://github.com/GHYAKIMA). I couldn't properly fork their project, they had some dual development setup for both Fabric and Forge, couldn't make any sense of it, so I decided to remake it myself and add some features.

## üõ† TODO
