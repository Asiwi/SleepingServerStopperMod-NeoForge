I'm basing my mod off of another port which has been archived, [EmptyServerStopper](https://github.com/GHYAKIMA/emptyserverstopper-mod) by [GHYAKIMA](https://github.com/GHYAKIMA). I couldn't properly fork his project so I decided to remake it myself and add some features.

## 🛠 TODO
- Add config file.

## 📄 Versions
- v1.0.0
  - Forge 1.20.1 (Will probably work on other versions. Haven't checked.)
  - Coded in Forge 1.20.1 47.2.0.
  - Hard coded values. 2 minute timer and the server will close on startup.
